discord token grabber - uses webhooks to transmit info



not responsible for bad things that people do with this

code is written mostly in rust, persistence is written in javascript

webhook is located in network.rs

might want to obfuscate the js file yourself (although will also require some changes to the rust code, unless you plan to hardcode it)
